                               Preheat your oven to 190ï¿½C.
                               In a small bowl, mix the flour and baking soda. Set aside.
                               In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth.
                               Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
                               Gradually add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until well combined.
                               Stir in the chocolate chips.
                               Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets.
                               Bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes or until the edges are golden brown.
                               Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.
